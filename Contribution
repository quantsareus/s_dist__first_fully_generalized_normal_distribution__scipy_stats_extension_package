You are very welcome to contribute to this tool! All you need to do to make your contribution on to the tool as a non development team member is the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/quantsareus/reprod<...>.git
2. cd reprod<...>
3. Make your edits.
4. git add --all
5. git commit -m '<description of your fabulous update>' 
6. git push origin <name_of_your_fork_branch>

However, before you can do that, you need to register on github.com, once.

If you are not familiar with the magic collab development tool 'git' already, search for the free ProGit_2020.pdf book (or a newer version) on duckduckgo.com. The book explains everything perfect.

Alternatively, it should also be possible to create a fork using the guthub web interface. In case request duckduckgo.com, how to perform that.


Your improved version has to meet four little requirements to get accepted to be incorporated into the main line version:

1. You have to provide a working version, that can be tried out.
2. The update version can still be distributed as a single file.
3. The update version does not contain a GUI element.
4. An update version usually contains the features of the current version.

Other than these few requirements will - from the author's point of view - unnecessarily complicate the tiny tool. The last requirement, however, might be discussed, when offerering a significant improvement of the tool, that's ready to use.


Your accepted fork currently gets merged into the main branch at least once a month, when I take my research days.


In case the author does provide a personal '# Further development options' note at the end of each python modul. If there is such, you very welcome to pick it up, if you like.
